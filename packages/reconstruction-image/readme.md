## Photogrammetry-pipeline:

This package consist of the initial preprocessing steps for feeding images then to the pipeline and some examples that are being implemented on pre-existing datasets for:
    - object detection.
    - object and surrounding plane reconstruction.

which is then stored into the overall algorithm implemented using SLAM techniques.
